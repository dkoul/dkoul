### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Test Engineer and a Software Quality Enthusiaist. I will put my testing ideology somewhere in the center of context-driven and analytical schools of testing.
My other passion is cognitive psychology and organizational behavior. I love to learn about how people interact and solve problems especially in a software context. I have been speaking at various meetups and conferences from last 8 years mostly about the 'human' aspect of software whether it is the developer or the customer.

I have a solid test automation experinece of around 13 years in various technologies on both UI and service layers -  Webdriver, Watir, pytest to name a few. Recently, I started working on a couple of projects using Puppeteer and Cypress which pulled me into JS world.

I am assisting my friends in building an exciting OKR tool at the moment.

I am a pragmatic diversity supporter and run Ministry of Testing - Pune meetup.

You can reach me at : kouldeep@gmail.com and ask me about-

testing, test automation, agile, emotional intelligence, usability, team dynamics, inclusion and diversity.
